## 🔍 Summary

The **Pressure-Field Theory of Gravity** proposes that gravity arises not from spacetime curvature but from **scalar pressure gradients** in a cosmic field (Φ).  
This field-based approach:

- Eliminates the need for dark matter  
- Explains galaxy rotation curves  
- Predicts CMB patterns and acoustic seeding  
- Recovers GR results in weak-field limits  
- Introduces scalar gravitational waves and lensing  
- Offers testable deviations in strong-field regimes

## 🧪 Key Features

- ✅ Unified Lagrangian with entropy and quantum terms  
- ✅ Scalar field Φ with photon coupling and cosmic expansion  
- ✅ Gravitational lensing and orbit drift via pressure  
- ✅ Matches M87* shadow and CMB peak positions  
- ✅ Zenodo DOI-linked, peer-style Overleaf version
