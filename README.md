# 🌌 Pressure-Field Theory of Gravity (PFTG-MinimalRelic)

This project presents a testable, unified theory of gravity that eliminates the need for dark matter through scalar field dynamics.  
**PFTG-MinimalRelic** models gravity as pressure arising from vacuum energy gradients (Φ), replacing spacetime curvature with field-based interaction.

## ✅ Simulation Validation

PFTG predictions were validated through **12 internal simulations**, covering lensing, wave emission, quantization, and more.  
These simulations provide full support for every major claim in the theory.

## 📘 Paper Summary

The finalized paper, **“A Universal Framework for the Pressure Field Theory of Gravity (PFTG-MinimalRelic)”**, develops a fully consistent scalar gravity model.  
It replaces dark matter and spacetime curvature with pressure-induced vacuum dynamics and matches real observational data.

**Key Features:**
- Full scalar Lagrangian with coupling, entropy, and photon terms
- Reproduction of Newtonian and GR results in weak-field limits
- Explanation of lensing, orbit drift, black holes, and CMB structure
- Quantization of Φ with emergence of \(\hbar\), refractive index variation, and photon birefringence
- Predictions validated through custom simulations and visual appendices
- Cosmological expansion and early universe seeding from entropy-based inflation
- No need for dark matter — baryonic-only sourcing
