# üåå Pressure-Field Theory of Gravity (PFTG-MinimalRelic)

A unified, testable theory of gravity that eliminates the need for dark matter through scalar pressure field dynamics.  
**PFTG-MinimalRelic** models gravity as arising from vacuum energy gradients (Œ¶), replacing spacetime curvature with pressure-based interaction.

## ‚úÖ Simulation Validation

PFTG predictions were validated through **12 internal simulations**, covering lensing, wave emission, quantization, and orbital dynamics.  
These simulations provide full support for every major claim in the theory.
