### 🔍 Summary

The Pressure-Field Theory of Gravity proposes that gravity arises not from spacetime curvature but from scalar pressure gradients in a cosmic field \(\Phi\).  
This field-based approach removes the need for dark matter, explains galaxy rotation curves, predicts CMB patterns, and recovers GR in weak fields.
